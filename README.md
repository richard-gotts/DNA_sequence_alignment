# DNA Sequence Alignment

This is one of the Mathematical Biology assessed practicals I completed in the first year of my Natural Sciences undergraduate degree.

This is an example of dynamic programming. The aim of the program is to take in two DNA sequences and work out their optimal alignment. The program consists of a single function which takes in the two sequences, along with a 'match score', a 'mismatch score', and a 'gap score'.

The function then performs an algorithm which assigns a score to every possible alignment and returns the alignment with the highest score. This article explains the process in more detail: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm
